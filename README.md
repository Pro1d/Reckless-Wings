It is a flight simulation racing game made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

TODO: find a better name, add a gameplay video, how to play.

## The ideas

The game combines two main concepts:
 * Piloting a light aircraft with high speed and controllability, like we can find in some flight simulators.
 * Racing in challenging maps, trying to find the perfect trajectory to beat your best time again and again (like in the awesome $free [TrackMania Nation](http://trackmaniaforever.com/)).

## Easy to take off but hard to master!

**The physic of flight is simplified...** to enjoy the game even if you are not a profesionnal pilot.
**...but not too much** to introduce difficulties for the most skillful players.

## Interested?
I could not find a game that brings these concepts together.
That is why I decided to create this game.
However, I do not have neither the desire nor the time to finish & publish this game.

You know a game of the same kind? Let me know! I want to have a try.

You want to create a similar game or fork this project? Please do! I would love playing a better game like this.

I am definetely interested in any work related to this kind of game ;)
